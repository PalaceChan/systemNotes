* on new install
rename (or dont sync at first) the .Rprofile to allow for package installation

run R and check =Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_USER")= then =mkdir -p= that directory
restart R and =.libPaths()= should reflect it

now can start to install packages by running

#+begin_src bash
  sudo pacman -S tk # to avoid error on tcltk to show cran mirror selection
#+end_src

#+begin_src R
  install.packages(c("lazyeval","abind","data.table","scales","digest","bit","bit64","hash","lubridate","nanotime","ggplot2","magrittr","purrr"))
  update.packages(lib.loc = "~/rlibs", oldPkgs = 'data.table')
#+end_src
