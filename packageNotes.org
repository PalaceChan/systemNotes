* mbsync
This required an app specific password from gmail settings as mbsync does not support 2-step auth.
On a first time sync use Timeout 0 to get through.
* mu
First run (assuming mbsync dir from above) do ~time mu index --maildir=~/mbsync~
* virtualbox
~sudo modprobe vboxdrv~ was failing the first time so had to ~sudo pacman -Syu~ to have latest headers.
the oracle extensions came from the usual AUR ~makepkg -si~
resolution was initially crap but with virtualbox closed one can fix by running ~VBoxManage setextradata "win10" CustomVideoMode1 2560x1440x32~
(and check it took effect with ~VBoxManage getextradata "win10" enumerate~
* telega
to get telegram in emacs, first tdlib which is in AUR
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/telegram-tdlib.git .
makepkg -si
#+END_SRC
then had to get from github the actual telegram package and build the server
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/zevlg/telega.el .
make && make install && make test
#+END_SRC
if it fails the =test= make sure you have visual-fill-column package from MELPA
then just ~M-x telega~
