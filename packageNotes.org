* mbsync
** This required an app specific password from gmail settings as mbsync does not support 2-step auth
** On a first time sync use Timeout 0 to get through
* mu
** First run (assuming mbsync dir from above) do ~time mu index --maildir=~/mbsync~
* virtualbox
** ~sudo modprobe vboxdrv~ was failing the first time so had to ~sudo pacman -Syu~ to have latest headers
** the oracle extensions came from the usual AUR ~makepkg -si~
got ISO from here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10ISO
can give it 4GB ram and 50GB dynamic hard disk (default type) and should just work after going through installer
* telega
to get telegram in emacs, first tdlib which is in AUR
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/telegram-tdlib.git .
makepkg -si
#+END_SRC
then had to get from github the actual telegram package and build the server
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/zevlg/telega.el .
make && make install && make test
#+END_SRC
if it fails the =test= make sure you have visual-fill-column package from MELPA
then just ~M-x telega~
