* mbsync
This required an app specific password from gmail settings as mbsync does not support 2-step auth.
On a first time sync use Timeout 0 to get through.
* mu
First run (assuming mbsync dir from above) do ~time mu index --maildir=~/mbsync~
* virtualbox
~sudo modprobe vboxdrv~ was failing the first time so had to ~sudo pacman -Syu~ to have latest headers.
the oracle extensions came from the usual AUR ~makepkg -si~
resolution was initially crap but with virtualbox closed one can fix by running ~VBoxManage setextradata "win10" CustomVideoMode1 2560x1440x32~
(and check it took effect with ~VBoxManage getextradata "win10" enumerate~)
to upgrade just pull in the AUR repo and check this thread: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/virtualbox-ext-oracle/
(I did have to ~makepkg -cfi~ twice on 20200322 for 6.1.4 to work)
* telega
to get telegram in emacs, first tdlib which is in AUR
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/telegram-tdlib.git .
makepkg -si
#+END_SRC
then had to get from github the actual telegram package and build the server
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/zevlg/telega.el .
make && make install && make test
#+END_SRC
if it fails the =test= make sure you have visual-fill-column package from MELPA
then just ~M-x telega~
* stdman
works better with ~M-x man~ than with helm which completes to full template scope and doesnt find it
* jupyterlab
If you get the error: from IPython.utils.py3compat import cast_unicode_py2, input
follow instructions here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59631663/jupyter-console-fails-to-start-but-jupyter-notebook-is-fine
namely change line 22 of ptshell.py like this until master branch gets fixed:

#from IPython.utils.py3compat import cast_unicode_py2, input
from ipython_genutils.py3compat import cast_unicode_py2, input
* ib-tws
~git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/ib-tws.git~
and just ~makepkg -si~ worked off the bat
